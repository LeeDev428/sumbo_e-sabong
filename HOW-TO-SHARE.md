# 🚀 SUPER EASY CLIENT SHARING (FREE & NO SETUP!)

## Just 3 Steps:

### 1️⃣ Build your app once:
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2️⃣ Double-click this file:
```
START-SHARE.bat
```

### 3️⃣ Copy the URL and send to your client!
You'll see something like: `https://random-name-1234.loca.lt`

---

## That's it! 🎉

Your client can open that URL from ANYWHERE in the world, even on their phone!

**No account needed. No credit card. 100% FREE. Works forever.**

---

## 📝 Important Notes:

- First time visitors see a warning page - just click **"Continue"**
- The URL changes each time you restart (or use `--subdomain yourname` for fixed URL)
- Keep the terminal window open while your client is viewing
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop sharing

---

## 🔄 If URL Stops Working:
Just press `Ctrl+C` and run **START-SHARE.bat** again!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips:

**Want the same URL every time?**
Edit START-SHARE.bat and change the last line to:
```
lt --port 8000 --subdomain your-unique-name
```

**Tunnel stopped but Laravel still running?**
Open Task Manager and kill the `php.exe` process, then restart.
